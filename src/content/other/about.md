## About ParadiseLabs

ParadiseLabs is a small AI engineering startup focused on making artificial intelligence more accessible, transparent, and useful for everyone. This blog documents our journey building open-source projects (like GLUE) and shares honest reflections on the challenges and breakthroughs we encounter along the way.

## Mission

Our mission is to make AI more accessible, transparent, and useful for everyone. We believe that AI should be a tool for everyone, not just a luxury for the wealthy, the experts and the well educated. Today's AI landscape should allow beginner's as well as experts alike to effectively develop complex, multi-step agentic AI systems, without the need for extensive knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, and software engineering.

## Vision

We're pioneering a new approach to orchestrating coding agents that moves beyond the limitations of intuitive but inconsistent "vibe coding" and other ad-hoc, often unpredictable approaches. This systematic framework enables developers to coordinate and orchestrate autonomous AI agents through defined objectives, planning phases, recursive execution cycles, and comprehensive context management. By establishing standardized interaction patterns, we aim to make advanced agentic AI more accessible, transparent, easier to control, and produce more reliable results for developers while seamlessly utilizing our custom multi-agentic autonomous AI developer framework, [GLUE](https://applyglue.com) (RELEASE DATE TBD, 2025).

## Values

- Better Development Tools for Beginners and Experts
- Streamlined Developer Experience for Rapid Iterative Development and Quicker Deployment
- Standardized Ways of Orchestrating AI Agents for Development
- More Effective and Reliable Solutions Than Vibe-Coding, While Remaining Just As Easy and Intuitive

*Let's build something great, together.*
