# Why I’m Building in Public (and Why You Should Too)

Building in public means sharing the journey—not just the highlights, but the messy middle, the experiments, and the honest lessons learned. I’m starting this blog to document my open-source work (like GLUE), my startup journey, and the real story behind the code.

**Why?**
- To connect with other makers and founders.
- To hold myself accountable.
- To inspire (and be inspired by) the community.
- To create a living record of progress, pivots, and breakthroughs.

If you’re a perfectionist or a founder who overthinks the launch, this is your invitation: ship early, share often, and let’s build something great—together.
