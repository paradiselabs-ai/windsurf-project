## About ParadiseLabs

ParadiseLabs is a small AI research company focused on making artificial intelligence more accessible, transparent, and useful for everyone. This blog documents our journey building open-source projects (like GLUE) and shares honest reflections on the challenges and breakthroughs we encounter along the way.

## Mission

Our mission is to develop a universal protocol that standardizes and bridges the fragmented landscape of AI technologies. We're creating a one-stop developer framework that seamlessly integrates diverse AI frameworks, APIs, MCP servers, agents, data sources, and model providers into a cohesive ecosystem. By eliminating compatibility barriers, we aim to accelerate innovation and make advanced AI capabilities accessible to developers regardless of their preferred tools or platforms.

## Values

- Build in public, always.
- Share progress, lessons, and failures.
- Help others launch faster, learn more, and connect.
