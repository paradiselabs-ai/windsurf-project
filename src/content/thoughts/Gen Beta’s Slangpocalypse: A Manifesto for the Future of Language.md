# The Future of Language

Ever wonder how far Gen Beta will go with slang? We are just now witnessing the **skibity brain rot** that is the dialect of Gen Alpha. So, I thought I would try a little experiment, a prophetic look into the (d)evolution of the English language.

I have written a manifesto, in a sort of tongue-in-cheek, prophesy, to predict what pure, generation beta, slanguage may sound like, and that is what I wrote this manifesto in, **PURE GENERATION BETA SLANG**. (Don’t worry, the normal English version comes after, and you can actually decode it line by line if you had the time/care to do so).

The goal was about 40% existing slang, and 60% made up slang, predicting how far the rabbit hole goes. If you want, I will comment a dictionary of my made up slang in the comments.

So here goes, the pure Generation Beta Slang version of “A Manifesto for the Future of Language”:

## Slay Da Ling Game for G🐝: A Manny to Lock the ReMixx Yeet of Slang as English Twizzes into its Finnel Skibidi Zlings

Lang’s a bussin’ beast, and it’s finna slay lead with G🐝 — those betas marypops upside str8 split-year dubba20 and yondo. This manny’s your drip to drop-a-comp in their cray-Z lingo, cooked by digi-rizz, globe-sauce, and queek culched flipz.

Such a pregga jam, Z’s and Alpha’s finna lowkey jelly they didn’t cop dat glish in da past release, but as G🐝’z like to spit wise: late stamps finna hate. It’s a deep tea-spill on soc’s waves, and a savage wink at our cling to “pure” talk, penned by d34d, that’s who it is wit 2LC <- index that triwp.

Eyez, Glish always been switchin’ up the bark. OG Glish was a glamma maze — protracted n’ stacked like it frontin’ to be a GOAT orsommin. Mid-Glish hist lay’d chilly w the vibez but chat, but chat, now Glish finna slay like fin&j. Every gen slaps the sauce, and the boomers, millys, even ZXYisdom bout to bcsalty. Real tea? Lemme spill it rainy:

Words like “cool” or “okay” may past behind sus side-eyes of wrinklers, now they’re core crik. Gen Zee and Alphy been up bussin’. They slayin with “slay” (hella nailin’ it), spillin “tea” (hot goss), and ride da “vibe”, that feel after a huge W.

It’s 🔥, bolt, fort for scrollin’. That’s the sparklers G🐝’z yeetin’ off.

G🐝’z slang? Natta finna be its final zlings — butt a big booty of raw skibidi brain (rot) flex. Words shrink to zippy sniktz, like “yep” but whizz. Emojis run the show — 🔥 says “lit,” 💤 says “donezo.” They’re mixin’ anime vox, Spanglish rizz, and app-locked sparkz into a florp jam so thicc it’s barely Glish. Might be SnapSpec (Snapchat-only vibes) or a globe-creole you can’t parse without the right plug. Haters call it lang’s ick, but history’s no cap: slang’s the forge where fresh talk bakes.

To lock in, peep this:

* Stan the twizz.
* Lang flips, periodt — it’s comin’ for you.
* Grip the new drip.
* Learn their lingo or you’re ghosted. 📡 ⤵️ & 💬.
* It’s a squad jam — dish out chat, text me the plan.

This ain’t just a pregga vibe — it’s tea on soc’s ReMixx. Lang’s splittin’ into micro-vibes, matchin’ a WRLD where we linkin up solo wit chu crew, scrollin’ feeds, slippin feetz on, ready like spongebob.

The savage shade (getchu glizzy and stay sunny, hear)? “Right” Glish is finna be yeeted into oblivvy soon, and our “fix it” rants are lowkey Ohio (more dalulu daily). It’s a loop, and it’s bussin’.

Fingame: G🐝’z slang ain’t trashin’ Glish — it’s juicin’ it. Plug in, and we keep comms pressed. Hop on da yondo train trax, no matter how dalulu evolulu skibidi doodoo it zlings.

Now, here is the same thing, written in plain English:

## A Manifesto for the Future of Language (Plain English Version)

Language is a dynamic, ever-evolving system, and it faces a profound shift with the rise of Generation Beta — those born in the mid-2020s and beyond. This manifesto, authored by d34d, (that’s me, I own an LLC, check it out!), serves as a guide to understanding and adapting to their emerging dialect, shaped by digital immersion, global interconnection, and rapid cultural changes.

It also provides a serious reflection on the societal implications of this evolution and a subtle satire of our fixation on linguistic correctness.

English has continually adapted to its speakers. Old English, with its intricate grammar and Germanic roots, evolved into the simpler Middle English after events like the Norman Conquest. Modern English, now a global language, further streamlined, incorporating diverse vocabulary. Each generation introduces informal terms, often met with criticism, yet words like “cool” or “okay” have transitioned from casual speech to standard usage.

Generations Z and Alpha have accelerated this process, creating a lexicon rooted in internet culture and social media. Their terms, such as “slay” (to excel), “tea” (gossip), and “vibe” (atmosphere), prioritize brevity, emotional resonance, and compatibility with digital platforms. These are not mere fads; they reflect a cultural shift toward rapid, expressive communication suited to online environments.

Generation Beta is likely to push this evolution to new extremes, crafting a dialect that may challenge comprehension. Their language will probably feature extreme concision, widespread use of symbols like emojis, and terms borrowed from global languages, driven by hyper-connected digital platforms. It may become specific to certain apps or communities, forming a digital creole that requires cultural fluency to understand. Critics may see this as English’s decline, but history suggests informal speech fuels linguistic innovation.

To prepare for the change, consider these steps:

* Accept the inevitability of change. Language evolves despite resistance.
* Learn the emerging vocabulary. Understanding new terms fosters inter-generational connection.
* Contribute to the lexicon. Adding your own expressions shapes its development.

This manifesto also reflects on broader societal trends. As language fragments into niche dialects, it mirrors a world of digital tribes — hyper-connected yet increasingly isolated. The satirical undertone lies in recognizing that today’s “correct” English will soon be obsolete, and our debates over standards will seem trivial in hindsight. This cycle of upheaval and adaptation is both inevitable and, in its persistence, faintly absurd.

Generation Beta’s language will not destroy English but redefine it. By engaging with it, we ensure communication remains vibrant and relevant. Embrace this future, however unfamiliar, to keep the conversation alive.
